# SouvenirProgram-Week2

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview
This C++ program is based on my personal hobby of collecting souvenirs.  
The goal of this project is to let the user enter details about souvenirs theyâ€™ve purchased and calculate the total cost.  
It also demonstrates user input validation, formatted output using `setw`, and writing the results to a file named `report.txt`.


## ðŸ’¡ Features
- Friendly introduction banner welcoming the user.  
- Prompts for three different input types:
  - **String:** Souvenir name (can include spaces)  
  - **Integer:** Quantity purchased  
  - **Double:** Price per item  
- Input validation to ensure all entered values are valid.  
- Calculates the **total cost** (quantity Ã— price).  
- Displays a formatted summary table using `setw` for alignment.  
- Saves the formatted report to a file called **report.txt**.
